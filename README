HTMLDoc plugin

You can write a HTML file typing tags. But in particular situations, you could desire to build HTML documents coding directly in Object Pascal.
For this purpose, you have HTMLDoc through which you can write headers, body with links and other relevant tags. And everything using only the frendly syntax of Object Pascal.

Installation
============

1. Open the package "htmldocpkg.lpk", in the dialog that opens, click in "Use >>" and "Add to Project";

Enjoy!
